# Fuel Planner Tab

Validated against commit: 708af0f  
Last updated: 2026-01-27  
Branch: work

## Purpose
The Fuel Planner Tab is the **human-in-the-loop planning interface** that:
- Presents a snapshot of live session state (fuel, pace, confidence).
- Allows the driver to **select authoritative planning inputs** (lap time + fuel per lap).
- Computes a **deterministic pit plan** using planner inputs, independent of live volatility.
- Exposes “readiness” gates so dashboards can safely auto-apply or inhibit live suggestions.

The planner does **not** replace the Fuel Model.  
It consumes the Fuel Model’s **live snapshot** and produces **explicit planning outputs** that are stable unless the user changes them.

Canonical references:
- Fuel behaviour contract: `Docs/FuelProperties_Spec.md`
- Planner/live flow: `Docs/FuelTab_SourceFlowNotes.md`
- Export definitions: `Docs/SimHubParameterInventory.md`

## Scope and boundaries

This doc covers:
- Planner inputs and precedence rules.
- How live data is surfaced vs applied.
- Readiness gating and snapshot semantics.
- Planner outputs and how they relate to live fuel model outputs.

Out of scope:
- Fuel burn acceptance, stability, and projection internals (see `Fuel_Model.md`).
- Dash rendering or UI layout details (see `Subsystems/Dash_Integration.md`).

---

## Inputs (planner-side)

### User-controlled inputs
These are **authoritative** once set by the user:

- **Estimated Lap Time**
  - Manual entry (explicit numeric value).
  - PB-derived race pace.
  - Profile average.
  - Live average (if explicitly applied).

- **Fuel Per Lap**
  - Manual entry.
  - Profile average.
  - Live average.
  - Session max (for safety scenarios).

- **Fuel to Add (MFD request)**
  - Used for pit math and pit window evaluation.
  - Clamped by tank capacity.

Planner inputs persist until explicitly changed by the user or reset by session identity change.

---

### Live snapshot inputs (read-only unless applied)
From the Fuel Model and Pace subsystem:
- Live fuel-per-lap (raw + stable).
- Fuel confidence.
- Live projection lap time.
- Tank capacity detection (live cap = MaxFuel × BoP, with BoP defaulting to 1.0).
- Pit loss estimates (lane + stop).
- Session context (race vs non-race).
- Live surface mode (wet/dry from tyre compound) and track wetness label for display.

These values **inform** the planner but do not overwrite user-selected inputs unless the user opts in.

Source of truth for snapshot flow: `FuelTab_SourceFlowNotes.md`.

---

## Internal state

### Planner-selected sources
The planner tracks *what source is currently active* for each input:

- `LapTimeSourceInfo`
  - manual / PB / profile / live
- `FuelPerLapSourceInfo`
  - manual / profile / live / max

### Track-condition handling (dry vs wet)
- **Manual selection:** Drivers can explicitly switch the planner into dry or wet mode (per-track).
- **Live Snapshot sync:** When the live surface mode is known (tyre compound), Live Snapshot mode auto-switches the planner to match unless the user has manually overridden the condition.
- **Wet factor support:** If wet mode is selected but only dry profile stats exist, the planner scales dry values by the wet factor percentage and labels the source accordingly.

### Max fuel override handling (profile vs live)
- **Profile mode:** `MaxFuelOverride` is clamped to the profile base tank (`BaseTankLitres`), and the UI shows a percent-of-base-tank badge.
- **Preset max fuel input:** Preset max fuel is expressed as a **percentage of base tank** (default 100%), making presets portable across cars with different base tanks.
- **Live Snapshot mode:** `MaxFuelOverride` is set from the live session cap (MaxFuel × BoP), or `0` if the live cap is unavailable.
- **Preset visibility in Live Snapshot:** Preset max-fuel values remain visible (read-only) so drivers can compare preset intent against live caps.
- **Mode transitions:** switching into Live Snapshot stores the previous profile override; switching back to Profile restores it and re-applies the selected preset (if any).
- **Validation:** if the live cap is missing in Live Snapshot mode, the planner surfaces an explicit “Live max fuel cap unavailable” error and blocks strategy outputs.

These are exposed to the UI so the driver can see **why** a number changed.

---

### Readiness and suggestion flags
- **IsFuelReady**
  - True only when Fuel Model stable confidence meets readiness threshold.
  - Used by dashboards and auto-apply logic to avoid premature live usage.

- **IsLiveLapPaceAvailable**
- **IsLiveFuelPerLapAvailable**
  - Indicate that live values exist, not that they should be used.

- **ApplyLiveFuelSuggestion / ApplyLiveLapSuggestion**
  - User-facing toggles.
  - Availability is tracked separately from application.

This separation is intentional and contractual.

---

## Calculation blocks (planner-side)

### 1) Source selection (authoritative precedence)
For both lap time and fuel per lap:

1. Manual entry (highest priority).
2. Explicit user action (PB / LIVE / PROFILE buttons).
3. Profile default (on load).
4. Live snapshot (suggestion only, unless applied).

At no point does live data silently override a user-selected value.

Contractual flow: `FuelTab_SourceFlowNotes.md`.

---

### 2) Planner projections
Using planner-selected lap time + fuel per lap:
- Total fuel required to finish.
- Fuel delta (surplus/deficit).
- Number of stops required by plan from the planner-feasible strategy result.
- Planner stop count and planner outputs are fully independent from the PreRace mode selector. PreRace Auto mirrors planner totals/stints when planner values are available, with runtime fallback only if planner values are unavailable. Auto delta now compares the driver’s live pit-menu refuel request against planner-required next add, so on-grid add changes update Auto delta live without altering planner math.
- Dash-facing pre-race visibility uses `LalaLaunch.PreRace.Stints` instead of separate stop-count exports.
- Pit add requirement.

These values are **planner-only** and intentionally decoupled from live volatility.

Exports are prefixed or grouped to distinguish planner vs live-derived values.

---

### 3) Pit loss integration
Planner pit math incorporates:
- Fuel add time (liters × refuel rate).
- Optional tyre change time.
- Pit lane travel loss (direct or DTL-based).

Loss values are sourced from the live pit timing subsystem but applied deterministically in the planner.

---

### 4) Snapshot refresh rules
Live snapshot values update continuously, but planner-selected values:
- Only change on explicit user action.
- Or reset on session identity change.

This ensures that the planner remains **predictable mid-race**.

Additional Live Session rules:
- The Live Session panel is **live-only**. When no live samples exist, summaries render `-` rather than falling back to profile values.
- When the car/track combination changes, the live snapshot is cleared immediately to prevent stale values (including max-fuel displays).

---

## Outputs (exports + UI bindings)

### Key planner outputs
(See `SimHubParameterInventory.md` for full list.)

Typical outputs include:
- Planner fuel required to end.
- Planner fuel delta.
- Planner pit stop count.
- Planner pit add amount.
- Planner projected pit loss.

These are distinct from live fuel model outputs and are safe to use for:
- Strategy displays.
- Dash overlays.
- Pre-race planning via `LalaLaunch.PreRace.*` adapter outputs.

---

### UI indicators
- Source labels (manual / live / profile / PB).
- Confidence/readiness indicators.
- Live suggestion availability markers.

These indicators exist to explain behaviour, not just decorate the UI.

---

## Dependencies / ordering assumptions
- Fuel Model must update before planner snapshot refresh.
- Pace subsystem must update before lap-time suggestions are valid.
- Tank capacity detection must be resolved before planner pit math is trusted.

---

## Reset rules

Planner state resets on:
- Session identity change (new session token).
- Car or track change.

On reset:
- Planner-selected sources revert to profile defaults.
- Manual overrides are cleared.
- Live snapshot is rehydrated but not applied.
- Live Snapshot UI fields clear to `-` until live samples populate.

Reset semantics are shared with the Fuel Model and documented centrally in:
`Docs/Reset_And_Session_Identity.md`.

---

## Failure modes / edge cases

- **Low confidence live data**
  - Live values may appear but `IsFuelReady == false`.
  - Planner must not auto-apply.

- **Tank capacity unknown**
  - Planner pit math may be inhibited or flagged.
  - UI should show explicit error/unknown state.

- **Replay sessions**
  - Live availability flags may flicker.
  - Planner stability should be verified via logs.

- **User confusion**
  - Most “why didn’t LIVE apply?” questions are explained by:
    - readiness gate,
    - source precedence,
    - or explicit manual override.

---

## Test checklist

1. **Pre-race load**
   - Planner defaults to profile lap time and fuel.
   - Live snapshot visible but not applied.

2. **Live suggestion gating**
   - Early laps: live values appear but `IsFuelReady == false`.
   - Once confidence rises: `IsFuelReady == true`.

3. **Explicit LIVE apply**
   - Press LIVE for lap time or fuel.
   - Source label updates.
   - Planner outputs recompute deterministically.

4. **Manual override**
   - Enter manual value.
   - Live suggestions no longer override.

5. **Session reset**
   - Change subsession/session.
   - Planner resets cleanly with no stale values.

---

## TODO / VERIFY

- TODO/VERIFY: Confirm exact confidence threshold used to set `IsFuelReady` and whether it differs for lap time vs fuel.  
- TODO/VERIFY: Confirm whether planner pit loss always prefers DTL or falls back to direct lane loss when DTL unavailable.  
- TODO/VERIFY: Confirm which planner outputs are exported as `_S` (smoothed) vs numeric only.
