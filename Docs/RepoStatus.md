Branch: work

## Current repo/link status
- Local branch present: `work`.
- No Git remote is configured in this checkout (`git remote -v` returns empty).

## Documentation sync status
- Reworked pit command transport to direct chat-command injection while keeping plugin-owned pit action endpoints for Strategy Dash / PitPopUp (`LalaLaunch.Pit.*`).
- Expanded plugin-owned pit action set (`ClearTires`, ±1/±10 fuel steps, `FuelSetMax`, `ToggleAutoFuel`, `Windshield`) with compatibility aliases retained for `Pit.FuelAdd` and `Pit.FuelRemove`.
- Added short-lived pit command feedback exports (`Pit.Command.DisplayText`, `Pit.Command.Active`) plus low-cost diagnostics (`Pit.Command.LastAction`, `Pit.Command.LastRaw`).
- Added explicit failure handling:
  - chat injection unavailability/failure warnings,
  - before/after mismatch warnings for stateful toggles,
  - user-facing `Pit Cmd Fail` fallback text.
- Tightened pit-command logging semantics so transport-stage warnings are explicitly best-effort; state-confirmation mismatch remains the authoritative failure signal for stateful actions.
- Added explicit `Tank Full` user-facing case for fuel-add actions using existing pit tank-space authority.
- Kept pit read-side authority unchanged: pit service status/selection remains telemetry-based (`dpFuelFill`, tyre selectors, `PlayerCarPitSvStatus` and related seams).
- Updated subsystem/user/internal docs and development changelog to match final direct-chat transport and feedback/failure contract.

## Delivery status highlights
- Kept ownership boundaries intact: dashboards remain presentation/control surfaces while plugin-owned actions own pit command dispatch.
- Preserved focused helper ownership (`PitCommandEngine`) for transport/mapping/feedback/failure logic instead of widening central runtime loops.
- Added bounded observability and short-lived user feedback exports so command success/failure is visible on dash and in SimHub logs.

## Validation note
- Validation recorded against `HEAD` (`Pit command transport switched to direct chat injection with confirmed feedback/failure handling`).
