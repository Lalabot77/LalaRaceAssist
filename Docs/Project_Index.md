## What this repo is
LalaLaunchPlugin is a SimHub plugin for iRacing that provides launch instrumentation, fuel strategy and planning, pit-cycle analytics, rejoin support, Shift Assist cueing, messaging, and multi-dash visibility coordination.

## Codex read/start order
1. If present at repo root, read `../AGENTS.md` as the thin agent entry point, then start with `Project_Index.md`.
2. Read `CODEX_CONTRACT.txt` for mandatory engineering policy.
3. Use `Architecture_Guardrails.md` for subsystem boundaries and ownership guidance.
4. Read the relevant `Subsystems/*.md` files before editing affected areas.
5. Check `RepoStatus.md` for the current validated repo/doc state.
6. Use `Code_Snapshot.md` only for orientation when needed; it is not canonical if it conflicts with the docs above.
7. Follow the analysis-first workflow and reusable task framing in `CODEX_TASK_TEMPLATE.txt`.

## Start here (canonical docs)
- [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - root-level agent pointer into the canonical docs workflow.
- [CODEX_CONTRACT.txt](CODEX_CONTRACT.txt) - mandatory Codex/global engineering policy.
- [Architecture_Guardrails.md](Architecture_Guardrails.md) - practical architecture boundaries and subsystem ownership guidance.
- [CODEX_TASK_TEMPLATE.txt](CODEX_TASK_TEMPLATE.txt) - reusable task skeleton for analysis-first Codex work.
- [Plugin_UI_Tooltips.md](Plugin_UI_Tooltips.md) - current tooltip inventory and UI navigation notes for plugin tabs and controls, including the Profiles/Dash/Global tidy-up layout.
- [SimHubParameterInventory.md](SimHubParameterInventory.md) - canonical SimHub export contract.
- [SimHubLogMessages.md](SimHubLogMessages.md) - canonical Info/Warn/Error log catalogue.
- [Subsystems/Shift_Assist.md](Subsystems/Shift_Assist.md) - Shift Assist purpose, inputs/state, outputs, and validation checklist.
- [Subsystems/Pit_Entry_Assist.md](Subsystems/Pit_Entry_Assist.md)
- [Subsystems/Track_Markers.md](Subsystems/Track_Markers.md)
- [Subsystems/Opponents.md](Subsystems/Opponents.md)
- [Subsystems/CarSA.md](Subsystems/CarSA.md)
- [Subsystems/Message_System_V1.md](Subsystems/Message_System_V1.md)
- [Subsystems/Dash_Integration.md](Subsystems/Dash_Integration.md)
